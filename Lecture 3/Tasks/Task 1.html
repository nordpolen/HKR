    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Josefina, and I am an aspiring frontend and web developer. I'm currently working as a consultant UX designer at a company called HiQ in Västerås.</p>
    <p>I have previously done work as a web developer for a startup company in Stockholm, back then I was mainly working in HTML and CSS only, so I look forward to this course and learning more about JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies: Powerlifting & Video Games</h2>
        <p>One of my main hobbies is powerlifting. I love the challenge of building strength and improving my technique with exercises like the squat, bench press, and deadlift. I enjoy going to the gym where I focus on discipline, determination, and self-improvement.</p>
        <p>In addition to powerlifting, I enjoy immersing myself in various worlds through video games. I like game genres like MOBA, puzzle, adventure, survival, FPS, and horror. Gaming is a great way for me to relax and have fun while also connecting with friends online.</p>
